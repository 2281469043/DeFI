## Guide to install the environment for read rds file to pandas dataframe

Use [env_install.sh](../scripts/env_install.sh) to install the environment.

here is a list of check if the script is not working.

<!-- Unorder list -->
- check the script is executable by running `ls -l env_install.sh` and see if the permission is `-rwx------`
if not, run `chmod 700 env_install.sh` to make it executable to the user.
- check if you are in the node instead of the landing pad(lp01), if not, run `ssh idea-node-XX` to go to the node.

if the script still don't work after above steps, come to rcos and I can help you set up the environment manually.

Or check this document to install the environment manually on your own.
